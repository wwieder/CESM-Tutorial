    "If you don't add anything to the namelist, CESM will generate its **``default output``**, as was done in previous chapters of this tutorial. Typically, the model outputs monthly means (and in some cases, higher frequency outputs) of a default set of variables. Depending on your needs, you may want to output variables at a different frequency, or add more variables, etc ...  \n",
