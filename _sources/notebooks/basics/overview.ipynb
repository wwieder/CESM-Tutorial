    "Welcome to the world of the **Community Earth System Model (CESM)**. CESM is a coupled Earth system model for simulating Earth’s climate system and connected component systems. The model is composed of separate models that simultaneously simulate the Earth’s atmosphere, ocean, land, river run-off, land-ice, and sea-ice.\n",
    "In this section you will be introduced to the basics behind CESM component models, coupling, code, workspaces, and running \n",
    "and archiving the results of CESM model simulations. Specifically we will cover the steps of:\n",
