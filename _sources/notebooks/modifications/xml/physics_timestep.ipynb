    "- **For the atmosphere component (CAM)**, the physics time step is set by `$ATM_NCPL` in `env_run.xml`. This variable specifies the number of coupling intervals per day between the atmosphere/land and the coupled system. Based on `ATM_NCPL`, the scripts will automatically compute the time step for the atmosphere and land and populate the namelist files accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **For the land component (CLM)**, the physics ime step is the same as the CAM time step; this is automatically set with the CAM time step via `ATM_NCPL`. You cannot set this separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **For the ocean component (POP2)**, the physics time step is changed in the `user_nl_pop` file and is based on `$OCN_NCPL` (found in `env_run.xml`), `dt_count` , and `dt_option`. The default `dt_option` is `“steps_per_day”`.\n",

    "- **For the sea ice component (CICE)**, the physics time step is set by the coupling interval variable `$ICE_NCPL` found in env_run.xml. "
