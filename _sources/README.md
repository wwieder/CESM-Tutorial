# Welcome to the [CESM Tutorial](https://ncar.github.io/CESM-Tutorial/README.html)

<br>

This repository includes materials for the Community Earth System Model (CESM) tutorial. These materials are designed to be used during the annual CESM tutorial and serve as reference documentation for any CESM user. The materials and notebooks in this tutorial are published as a Jupyter book here to allow for searchable online documentation, but to run the actual commands presented you will need to use a terminal window. 

## Goals of This Tutorial

This tutorial is designed as an introduction to running the CESM model. **By the end of this online tutorial you should learn how to run and modify the model and use the output.** 

This tutorial includes the following topics:
* The basics of running CESM
* Simple modifications of xml files, source code, and namelists
* Some challenge exercises
* Troubleshooting
* Basic diagnostics
* Useful tools

## CESM Technical Help

As you gain experience using and running CESM, the [DiscussCESM Forums](https://bb.cgd.ucar.edu/cesm/) are a place where the CESM Community can request assistance with science and runtime issues.

## CESM Community Involvement

NCAR created the Community Climate Model (CCM) in 1983 that included a global atmosphere. In 1994, NCAR scientists started to develop the Climate System Model (CSM) that included models of the atmosphere, land surface, ocean, and sea ice. In order to recognize the Community of users and sponsors, the CSM was renamed to the Community Climate System Model (CCSM). With addititons including an ice sheet and biogeochemical modeling, the model was renamed to the Community Earth System Model (CESM) in 2013. 

The CESM project has a strong commitment to Community involvment in governance and development of the CESM. We welcome and strongly encourage anyone interested to join the [CESM working groups](https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/working-groups) to participate more fully in the CESM project and model development. 

There is also a long history of open, Community workshops. The first Community workshop was held in 1996 and continues annually today. We hope to see you at a future [CESM workshop](https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/events/workshops)!

The CESM tutorial has been offered regularly since 2010 and is typically offered annually during the summer. If you are interested in attending the tutorial and have not attended a tutorial before, please see the [CESM webpage](https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/events/tutorials) for the most up to date information about when the tutorial will next be offered in Boulder, Colorado and the timeline for applying.

## CESM Project Funding 

This material is based upon work supported by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), which is a major facility sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF) under Cooperative Agreement No. 1852977. Staff time on this project was also supported by the Climate and Global Dynamics (CGD) laboratory.

## Acknowledgements

A number of people have been critical to this effort, including:

- Alice DuVivier, Cecile Hannay, Peter Lawrence, and Hui Li, who serve on the CESM tutorial committee and put together the tutorial materials.
- Brian Dobbins, who led technical aspects of the tutorial materials. 
- Gunter Leguy, Gustavo Marques, Jesse Nusbaumer, and Adam Phillips, who serve on the CESM tutorial committee and helped test materials.
- Elizabeth Faircloth, who supports the CESM program administratively and without whom everything would probably fall apart.
- Gokhan Danabasoglu, who supported this effort as CESM chief scientist.
- Testers
